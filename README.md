# Emergency Info App

On this App ypu will be able to create an account, sign in then enter some important medical information in case of an emergency you can have it handy.

## To create this app I use the following:

    "bcryptjs"
    "connect-mongo"
    "dotenv"
    "ejs"
    "express"
    "express-session"
    "method-override"
    "mongoose"
    "morgan"

### Project status

    As of right now the app is working properly, but the next step is to be able to add pictures and once you enter all of your information, you should be able to generate a QR code.
